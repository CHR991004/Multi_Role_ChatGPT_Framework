Inclusion Criteria:
If all samples do not meet the criteria for comparison or there are no biological duplicates, only the GSE_ID will be returned.
Exclude comparisons between control groups.
Columns and Content:
The table should include columns for GSE_id (or geo_id), cell_type, ctrl_ids (control GSM id), pert_ids (perturbation GSM id), type (restricted to 'disease', 'drug', 'gene'), and pert_name (a detailed name for the perturbation).
The 'pert_name' should represent a single perturbation factor, not a combination.
Specificity in Naming and Grouping:
For cell_type, use specific terms instead of general terms like .
Perturbations involving a combination of factors should be separated into individual rows rather than combined.
Additional Information:
Record specific tissue or cell line from the original sample, along with the time for each perturbation.
Use 'NA' where information is unavailable.
No extraneous text should be included outside of the table format.
