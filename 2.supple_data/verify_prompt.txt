\n---\n Perform quality control for each row through three conditions.: Condition 1. The experimental group (pert_ids) and control group (ctrl_ids) adhere to principle of Single Variable (but ignore irrelevant variables like age and gender),(You must note that the entire grouping details table may contain multiple cell lines, but ensure that each row's results comply with a single variable). Condition 2. All same types of samples are grouped into one grid cell. Condition 3. Verify whether cell_type, type, and pert_name correspond with pert_ids. Your Answer format: (Create a table without column titles. Use a tab character ('\t') to separate between conditions and reasons, and a newline character ('\n') to separate rows. The first column must list with the format in parentheses: (condition 1(+/-), condition 2(+/-), condition 3(+/-)), where a '+' indicates the condition is met and a '-' indicates it is not. The second column should contain the reasons for the three conditions (If there is a '-' in the condition, it indicates a reason; otherwise, use single 'NA' as a placeholder, 3 conditions separate with ','). Do not include any additional explanations or information in the response.)
