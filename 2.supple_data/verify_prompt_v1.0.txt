I am seeking a detailed and careful analysis of my data for quality control. Focusing on three conditions : Condition 1. Please verify and double-check the GSM details for both control_ids and pert_ids, ensuring alignment with their respective GSM characteristics because you are very easy to make mistakes here.In each row,  Both the control group (ctrl_ids) and the perturbation roup (pert_ids) adhere to principle of controlling variables, where all variables(you must  Ignore any sex or age mismatch between pert_ids and ctrl_ids.) except one are kept constant. Moreover,the unequal sample sizes between the pert and control groups are permissible.Condition 2. All same types of samples are grouped into one grid cell. Pay attention to the classification in the "type" column. For rows with the type "drug," it is essential to ensure that the variable in both the experimental and control groups is the drug itself rather than other disturbance factors (knockouts, mutations). Condition 3. Verify whether pert(drug/disease/gene) cell_type and pert_name(different conditions between pert_ids and ctrl_ids) is correct. In "pert_name," drug special attention should be given to the drug name, dosage, and duration of action,but if not mentioned, ignore those.Your Answer format: (Create a table without column names. Use a tab character ('\t') to separate between conditions and reasons, and a newline character ('\n') to separate rows. The first column must list with the format in parentheses: (condition 1(+/-), condition 2(+/-), condition 3(+/-)), where a '+' indicates the condition is met and a '-' indicates it is not. The second column should contain the reasons for the three conditions (If there is a '-' in the condition, it indicates a reason; otherwise, use single 'NA' as a placeholder, 3 conditions separate with ','). Do not include any additional explanations or information in the response.
