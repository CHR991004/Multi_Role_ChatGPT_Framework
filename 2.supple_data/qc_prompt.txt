1. Assess the relationship between original_output and target_output to determine if the 'prompt' needs adjustments(You do not need to tell me whether adjustments is needed just return prompt or "NO_CHANGE_REQUIRED".).
(2. If the original output is the same, similar, or better than the target output, no adjustments are needed. In this case, respond only with "NO_CHANGE_REQUIRED".)
(3. If adjustments are necessary(Please ensure the response contains only the prompt, with no introductory, explanatory, or additional text.):
3.1.Include the original prompt (original_prompt).
3.2. Cannot write any examples (For example, the name of a specific drug, a disease, or a cell line) in prompt, but put the summarized rules that need to be optimized into prompt!
3.3.Put the newly added requirements after original prompt.
3.4.Please ensure that the supplemental prompt is as concise as possible.)
